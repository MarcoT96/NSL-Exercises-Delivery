The folder contains one subfolder related to the single 
point of the exercise.
In this folder is present a makefile: if deemed 
appropriate code the 'make' command to generate the executable
'main.exe'; otherwise, folders already contain simulation 
results saved to files typically in .dat format.

The explanation of the C++ classes I have created is present 
in part in the jupyter-notebook and in more details in GA_TSP.h 
and GA_TSP.cpp.

I also produced two animations (gift files) related to the optimization 
of the best path between cities: they are very nice so if they are not visible 
for any reason in the notebook they are located within the same folder of the latter.

The comment on the results is contained in the 
jupyter-notebook named 'Numerical Exercises 9.ipynb'
