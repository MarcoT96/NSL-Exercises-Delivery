## Exercise 09

<br>
The folder contains one subfolder related to the only point of the exercise.<br>

In this folder there is a makefile: if deemed appropriate download the C++ files
and code the `make` command to generate the executable <strong>'main.exe'</strong>; otherwise,
folders already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat format.<br>
The explanation of the C++ classes I have created is present in part in the jupyter-notebook and in more details in GA_TSP.h and GA_TSP.cpp. <br>
I also produced two animations (**gift** files) related to the optimization of the best path between cities: they are very nice so 
if they are not visible for any reason in the notebook they are located within the same folder of the latter. <br>
The comment on the results is contained in the jupyter-notebook named <strong>'Numerical Exercises 9.ipynb'</strong>.<br>
This notebook does not appear in full form when viewed through `GitHub`: download the jupyter file and
open it locally to see <em>colors</em>, <em>titles</em>, <em>equations</em> and <em>graphs</em> correctly.
