The folder contains three subfolders related to the
three points of the exercise.
In each of this folder there is a makefile: if deemed 
appropriate code the 'make' command to generate the executable
'main.exe'; otherwise, folders already contain simulation 
results saved to files typically in .dat format.
The comment on the results is contained in the 
jupyter-notebook named 'Numerical Exercises 1.ipynb'

In exercise 01.3 I produce an image 'Buffon's Needle.png' with
Inkscape in which I outline the Buffon's experiment.
