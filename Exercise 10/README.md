The folder contains two subfolder related to the two 
point of the exercise.
In these folders is present a makefile: if deemed 
appropriate code the 'make' command to generate the executable
'main.exe'; otherwise, folders already contain simulation 
results saved to files typically in .dat format.

The explanation of the C++ classes I have created is present 
in part in the jupyter-notebook and in more details in TSP.h 
and TSP.cpp.

I also produced two animations (gift files) related to the optimization 
of the best path between cities with Simulated Annealing in folder 10.1:
they are very nice so if they are not visible 
for any reason in the notebook they are located within the folder 
./10.1/Circumference and ./10.1/Square.

In Exercise 10.2 code 'mpiexec -np 4 main.exe' to run the MPI
Parallel GA Searches.

The comment on the results is contained in the 
jupyter-notebook named 'Numerical Exercises 10.ipynb'
