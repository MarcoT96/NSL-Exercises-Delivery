## Exercise 10

<br>
The folder contains two subfolders related to the two points of the exercise.<br>

In each of these folders there is a makefile: if deemed appropriate download the C++ files
and code the `make` command to generate the executable <strong>'main.exe'</strong>; otherwise,
folders already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat format. <br>

The explanation of the C++ classes I have created is present in part in the jupyter-notebook
and in more details in TSP.h and TSP.cpp. <br>
I also produced two animations (gift files) related to the optimization 
of the best path between cities with Simulated Annealing in folder 10.1: they are very nice but for size reasons,
I could not upload them to this repository and always for reasons related to file size they are not visible even in the jupyter-notebook. <br>

In Exercise 10.2 code **'mpiexec -np 4 main.exe'** to run the MPI Parallel GA Searches. <br>
All other files and folders have self-explanatory name. <br>

The comment on the results is contained in the jupyter-notebook named <strong>'Numerical Exercises 10.ipynb'</strong>.<br>
This notebook does not appear in full form when viewed through `GitHub`: download the jupyter file and
open it locally to see <em>colors</em>, <em>titles</em>, <em>equations</em> and <em>graphs</em> correctly.
