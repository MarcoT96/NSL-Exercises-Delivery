The folder contains three subfolders related to the
three points of the exercise.
In each of this folder there is a makefile: if deemed 
appropriate code the 'make' command to generate the executable
'main.exe' (or 'qmc1d' in the case of 08.3); otherwise, folders
already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat.
The comment on the results is contained in the 
jupyter-notebook named 'Numerical Exercises 8.ipynb'
