The folder contains one subfolder related to the single 
point of the exercise.
In this folder is present a makefile: if deemed 
appropriate code the 'make' command to generate the executable
'Monte_Carlo_ISING_1D.exe'; otherwise, folders already contain simulation 
results saved to files typically in .dat format.
In this case I save the results for the various temperatures
in appropriate named subfolders, each with its own parameters file 'input.dat'.
The comment on the results is contained in the 
jupyter-notebook named 'Numerical Exercises 6.ipynb'
