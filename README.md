## Numerical Simulation Laboratory Exercises Delivery

This repository contains the exercises solved during the Numerical Simulation Laboratory course 
that I attended in the second year of my Masterâ€™s degree in Physics at the University of Milan.
Each of the folders corresponds to a single exercise, has self-explanatory name, and contains both `C++` codes, and `jupyter-notebooks`
in which the results obtained are presented and commented.

The main themes of each exercise are summarised below.

- `Exercise 01`: Random Numbers Generator & CLT
- `Exercise 02`: Monte Carlo Quadrature & Random Walk
- `Exercise 03`: Econophysics & Black-Scholes Theory
- `Exercise 04`: Basics of Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Argon
- `Exercise 05`: Intro to Metropolis Algorithm & the Hydrogen Atom
- `Exercise 06`: Metropolis & Gibbs Algorithms for the 1D Ising Model
- `Exercise 07`: Monte Carlo Simulation of Argon
- `Exercise 08`: Intro to Variational Monte Carlo & Path Integral Monte Carlo methods
- `Exercise 09`: TSP via Genetic Algorithm
- `Exercise 10`: TSP via Simulated Annealing & Intro to MPI
- `Exercise 11`: Intro to Feed Forward Neural Networks for Regression problems 
- `Exercise 12`: Intro to Deep Neural Networks for Classification problems

  <b>Note:</b> <br>
  The exercises that require the use of the random number generator adopted in the course refer to the files contained 
  in the folder `Parallel Random Numbers Genetor` (Primes and seed.in files), which must therefore be necessarily present
  in order to call the command `make` and compile executables (typically main.cpp files).
