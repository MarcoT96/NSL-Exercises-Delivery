## Numerical Simulation Laboratory Exercises Delivery

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
 
  <b>Note</b> <br>
  I had problems with loading due to the presence of big files (size greater than <strong>25 MB</strong>) in my local repository; these files contain results of 
  more expensive simulations that I tried to do or, as in the case of Exercise 10, contain animations that I wanted to show in jupyter-notebooks.
  As a result, the notebooks do not appear on `Github` as I would have liked; in fact there are missing parts, such as the titles of the various paragraphs.
  I tried to report any issues related to this kind of thing in the various README.md files present in each of the folders related to the delivered exercises:
  in case of problems, consult first those and eventually me at a later time.

This repository contains the exercises solved during the Numerical Simulation Laboratory course that I attended in the second year of
my Masterâ€™s degree in Physics at the University of Milan. <br>
Each of the folders corresponds to a single exercise, has self-explanatory name, and contains both `C++` codes, and `jupyter-notebooks`
in which the results obtained are presented and commented.

The main themes of each exercise are summarised below.

- `Exercise 01`: Random Numbers Generator & CLT
- `Exercise 02`: Monte Carlo Quadrature & Random Walk
- `Exercise 03`: Econophysics & Black-Scholes Theory
- `Exercise 04`: Basics of Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Argon
- `Exercise 05`: Intro to Metropolis Algorithm & the Hydrogen Atom
- `Exercise 06`: Metropolis & Gibbs Algorithms for the 1D Ising Model
- `Exercise 07`: Monte Carlo Simulation of Argon
- `Exercise 08`: Intro to Variational Monte Carlo & Path Integral Monte Carlo methods
- `Exercise 09`: TSP via Genetic Algorithm
- `Exercise 10`: TSP via Simulated Annealing & Intro to MPI
- `Exercise 11`: Intro to Feed Forward Neural Networks for Regression problems 
- `Exercise 12`: Intro to Deep Neural Networks for Classification problems

  <b>Note</b> <br>
  The exercises that require the use of the random number generator adopted in the course refer to the files contained 
  in the folder `Parallel Random Numbers Genetor` (Primes and seed.in files), which must therefore be necessarily present
  in order to call the command `make` and compile executables (typically main.cpp files).

  <b>INFO</b> <br>
  I strongly suggest **not restart the kernel** of jupyter-notebooks once downloaded, except in cases of extreme necessity.
  Instead I recommend running only the very first two Python code cells, which allow **to hide** the Python codes that follow and display the images in the center   
  of the Notebook. <br>
  In this way the reading of the jupyter-notebook is more orderly.
  **Once I take the exam, I will remove all the Jupyter Notebook, leaving only the C++ codes and files related to these.**
