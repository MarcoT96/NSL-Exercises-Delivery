## Exercise 04

<br>
The folder contains four subfolders related to the four points of the exercise.<br>

In each of this folder there is a makefile: if deemed appropriate download the C++ files
and code the `make` command to generate the executable <strong>'main.exe'</strong>; otherwise,
folders already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat format.<br>
In turn, each of these sub-folders contains three more, related to the three phases of the simulated Argon system: *solid*, *liquid* and *gas*. <br>
In particular, I would like to highlight the following issues:

- folder `04.2` contains only the code updated with the implementation of the **blocking method**, I did not do any simulation here
-
-

The comment on the results is contained in the jupyter-notebook named <strong>'Numerical Exercises 4.ipynb'</strong>.<br>
This notebook does not appear in full form when viewed through `GitHub`: download the jupyter file and
open it locally to see <em>colors</em>, <em>titles</em>, <em>equations</em> and <em>graphs</em> correctly.



The folder Optional Exercise contains the data that I will use
for the comparison between MD and MC Argon simulations, and include
the calculation of pressure and g(r) in the best equilibrium conditions
that I managed to obtain for the three phases
