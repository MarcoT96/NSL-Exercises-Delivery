The folder contains four subfolders related to the
four points of the exercise.
In each of this folder there is a makefile: if deemed 
appropriate code the 'make' command to generate the executable
'MolDyn_NVE.exe'; otherwise, folders already contain simulation 
results saved to files typically in .dat format.

In particular in 04.3/dt_reduced/solid, 04.3/dt_reduced/liquid and
04.3/gas there are the animations made with Ovito of the three
phases that I simulated: I would have liked to put them in the 
notebook but I had trouble doing it!

The folder Optional Exercise contains the data that I will use
for the comparison between MD and MC Argon simulations, and include
the calculation of pressure and g(r) in the best equilibrium conditions
that I managed to obtain for the three phases, i.e. the ones for which 
I also saved the animation video mentioned above.

The comment on the results is contained in the 
jupyter-notebook named 'Numerical Exercises 4.ipynb'
