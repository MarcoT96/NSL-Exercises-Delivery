## Exercise 05

<br>
The folder contains one subfolder related to the only point of the exercise.<br>

In this folder there is a makefile: if deemed appropriate download the C++ files
and code the `make` command to generate the executable <strong>'main.exe'</strong>; otherwise,
folders already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat format.<br>
In the `Github` repository are missing the two files that contain 3D points sampled through the Metropolis 
algorithm, with which I produced the four three-dimensional plots that appear at the end of the jupyter-notebook. <br>
For these two files the considerations made in `README.md` of `Exercise 04` regarding the missing files are valid. <br>
The comment on the results is contained in the jupyter-notebook named <strong>'Numerical Exercises 5.ipynb'</strong>.<br>
This notebook does not appear in full form when viewed through `GitHub`: download the jupyter file and
open it locally to see <em>colors</em>, <em>titles</em>, <em>equations</em> and <em>graphs</em> correctly.
