## Exercise 07

<br>
The folder contains three subfolders related to the three points of the exercise.<br>

In each of these folders there is a makefile: if deemed appropriate download the C++ files
and code the `make` command to generate the executable <strong>'Monte_Carlo_NVT.exe'</strong>; otherwise,
folders already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat format.<br>
In turn, each of these sub-folders contains three more, related to the three phases of the simulated Argon system: *solid*, *liquid* and *gas*. <br>
In particular, the codes and the results of **exercise 07.3** are in the folder related to the `Optional Exercise` of the **Molecular Dynamics**. <br>
The comment on the results is contained in the jupyter-notebook named <strong>'Numerical Exercises 7.ipynb'</strong>.<br>
This notebook does not appear in full form when viewed through `GitHub`: download the jupyter file and
open it locally to see <em>colors</em>, <em>titles</em>, <em>equations</em> and <em>graphs</em> correctly.
