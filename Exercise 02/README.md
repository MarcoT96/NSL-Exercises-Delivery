## Exercise 02

<br>
The folder contains two subfolders related to the two points of the exercise.<br>

In each of these folders there is a makefile: if deemed appropriate download the C++ files
and code the `make` command to generate the executable <strong>'main.exe'</strong>; otherwise,
folders already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat format.<br>
The comment on the results is contained in the jupyter-notebook named <strong>'Numerical Exercises 2.ipynb'</strong>.<br>
This notebook does not appear in full form when viewed through `GitHub`: download the jupyter file and
open it locally to see <em>colors</em>, <em>titles</em>, <em>equations</em> and <em>graphs</em> correctly.
