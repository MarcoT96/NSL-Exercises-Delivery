## Exercise 01

<br>
The folder contains three subfolders related to the three points of the exercise.<br>

In each of this folder there is a makefile: if deemed appropriate download the C++ files
and code the `make` command to generate the executable <strong>'main.exe'</strong>; otherwise,
folders already contain simulation results saved to files typically in .dat format.<br>
The comment on the results is contained in the jupyter-notebook named <strong>'Numerical Exercises 1.ipynb'</strong>.<br>
This notebook does not appear in full form when viewed through `GitHub`: download the jupyter file and
open it locally to see <em>colors</em>, <em>titles</em>, <em>equations</em> and <em>graphs</em> correctly.
In the folder `01.3` I produce an image, **'Buffon's Needle.png'** by using Inkscape in which I outline the Buffon's experiment.
This image is also present in the notebook.
